# ESP32
Various ESP32 projects

I am a coder with >30 years experience. In the dim past, I modified industrial
analog controllers (knobs and switches) to use software control.

I recently purchased a few turnkey LoRa nodes and was immediately struck by the
poor quality of ALL of the software. Not trying to knock the radio folks, but
they are not programmers.

So, after almost 30 years since doing anything that required a soldering iron,
I purchased a pile of components and so forth on AliExpress and I'm teaching
myself to fiddle with it all.

Initial bits will just be dev-board specific exercises to understand the
differences between the various common, cheap boards.

Stay tuned.
